## Binary heaps: homework 2 (24/3/2020)

### 1.
The code required by the exercise is inside the folder `Ad_bin_heaps_no_swaps`, organised as the provided repository `AD_bin_heaps` ([git repo binary heaps](https://github.com/albertocasagrande/AD_bin_heaps)). Typing `make` in the terminal will produce, as for the previous homework, two executable `test_insert` and `test_delete_min` testing the main functions implemented for binary heaps, and comparing the time elapsed when deleting the minimum element from a binary heap and from an array (provided that the keys of the heap's node are the same elements of the array).

### 2.

* if build, is_empty $\in \Theta(1)$ and extract_min $\in \Theta(|D|)$, then:

$T(|D|) = \Theta(1) + \sum_{i=1}^{|D|} (\Theta(1)+ \Theta(|D|)) = \Theta(1) + \sum_{i=2}^{|D|}\Theta(|D|) \in \Theta(|D|^2)$.

* if build $\in \Theta(|A|)$, is_empty $\in \Theta(1)$ and extract_min $\in O(\log(n))$, then, assuming $|A| = n = |D|$, we can put an upper-bound to the complexity of the algorithm in the following way:

$T(n) = \Theta(n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\Theta(1)+O(\log(n))) = \Theta(n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}O(\log(n)) = \\ = \Theta(n) + O(n\cdot \log(n)) \in O(n\cdot \log(n))$.
